This repository contains code for the Kaggle competition [COVID-19 Open Research Dataset Challenge (CORD-19)](https://www.kaggle.com/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge)

## Approaches
Right now only one, later a second more involved one.
Link to corresponing notebook on [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/n3xtvision/riskfactors-patternmatching) (WIP)

###  Pattern Matching
First basic approach to get used to the data format is based on pattern matching via regex.
I applied that code on the propsed question "What do we know about COVID-19 risk factors?
".

### General QA system
#### TODO

### Plans:

I have planned to implement a question answering system, first based on some pre-trained language model like BERT.
Then when time allows I will adapt it to be more specific to the domain of COVID-19.
