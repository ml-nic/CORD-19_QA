Recent data examined the mortality in patients with MERS-CoV and the gender relationships, looking at the survival of cases among females and males. It was suggested that males have a higher risk of death [61, 62] ; however, this was contradicted by the findings from two other studies which suggested that males have a low risk of death [63] ; while another survey which examined the influence of gender on 3-day and 30-day survival, found a low risk of death especially in the older age group \n",

In isolated human bronchi, high glucose concentrations can lead to enhance responsiveness of airway smooth muscle cells to a contractile agent via a specific cellular pathway mediated by Rho-kinase (Cazzola et al., 2012) . Enhanced airway hyperrresponsiveness is a major risk factor for the accelerated decline in pulmonary function seen in COPD patients. Furthermore, hyperglycaemia may also increase the risk of pulmonary infections by rendering the appearance of glucose in airway secretion, making the respiratory tracts vulnerable to infectious exacerbations (Cazzola et al., 2\n",

Targeted screening of high-risk patients or all patients on entry into high-risk units are strategies to prevent CA-MRSA from becoming endemic in hospitals.

The risk for transmission is greatest with healthcare workers, especially when aerosol-generating procedures are performed. Other risk factors are increased age, male sex, presence of comorbid conditions, and household contact with a probable case of SARS.

We aimed to construct an effective model for early identifying cases at high risk of progression to severe COVID-19. China were included retrospectively. All patients with non-severe COVID-19 during hospitalization were followed for more than 15 days after admission. Patients who deteriorated to severe or critical COVID-19 and patients who kept non-severe state were assigned to the severe and non-severe group, respectively. We compared the demographic, clinical, and laboratory data between severe and non-severe group. Based on baseline data, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) algorithm and logistic regression model were used to construct a nomogram for risk prediction in the train cohort. The predictive accuracy and discriminative ability of nomogram were evaluated by area under the curve (AUC) and calibration curve. Decision curve analysis (DCA) and clinical impact curve analysis (CICA) were conducted to evaluate the clinical applicability of our nomogram. diabetes, coronary heart disease, chronic respiratory disease, tuberculosis disease. We found one demographic and six serological indicators (age, serum lactate dehydrogenase, C-reactive protein, the coefficient of variation of red blood cell distribution width (RDW), blood urea nitrogen, albumin, direct bilirubin) are associated with severe COVID-19. Based on these features, we generated the nomogram, which has remarkably high diagnostic accuracy in distinguishing individuals who exacerbated to severe COVID-19 from non-severe COVID-19 ( Our nomogram could help clinicians to early identify patients who will exacerbate to severe COVID-19.
