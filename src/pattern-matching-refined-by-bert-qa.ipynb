There is substantial variation in the time to publication within the study designs. We did 146 not quantify several factors that likely influence this duration such as the size of the outbreak, the 147 research capacity or outbreak preparedness. Small outbreaks or small population sizes limit the 148 opportunity to enrol sufficient patients with adverse outcomes, and unless involved in 149 multi-centre/multi-region studies, these regions are less likely to produce high quality epidemiological 150 studies. The same holds true for regions with limited research capacity, such as appropriate diagnostic 151 facilities and expertise. Outbreak preparedness likely increased over time, with funding increasing after 152 the PHEIC, meaning that initiation of studies started relatively late for regions that were affected 153 earliest by the outbreak.

For example, individuals vaccinated for both parvovirus and H. felis could potentially be at lower risk of Babesia and CDV infection. Conversely, our networks show that there could be unintended consequences of controlling a pathogen, as has been shown for deworming (Fenton 2013). For example, it is possible that vaccination targeting coronavirus in this population could increase B. gibsoni infections that may, in turn, lead to a higher risk of CDV exposure. Whilst these relationships are correlative rather than mechanistic, it is clear from our study that relationships between microparasites are common and should be considered in disease management.

To improve the extraction of relevant text one can consider better search/ranking algorithms like BM25.\nThis step of filtering out non relevant text is very important not only because it improves the performance of the downstream QA model, but also because it reduces the amount of data massively, without it we can not apply a huge language model.\n\nOne problem of the QA approach is that the model is not perfectly suited for this problem setting, i.e. even though we used SCIBERT, which was trained on scientific articles, this model was not trained for question answering. There are models which are trained on SQUAD, which is a question answering dataset, but those data is not from the medical domain.\n\nI think the performance can be improved by first use a better ranking algorithm to identify relevant documents/text passages and then train/retrain a language model on scientific/medical question answering.\n\nThe summarization part is probably hard to improve, of course we also should be able to improve performance by using a model which was trained on domain specific data, but summarizing of the non contiguous texts seems to be quite hard."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Some resources used:\n\n    - https://huggingface.co/blog/how-to-generate\n    - https://www.kaggle.com/jonathanbesomi/a-qa-model-to-answer-them-all#9.-Export-solutions (parts of this notebook are based on that, not my work)\n    - https://www.kaggle.com/n3xtvision/riskfactors-patternmatching (parts of this notebook are based on that, my work)"},{"metadata":{"pycharm":{"is_executing":true},"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"pycharm":{"is_executing":true,"name":"#%%\n"},"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"pycharm":{"is_executing":true,"name":"#%%\n"},"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.7.7"},"pycharm":{"stem_cell":{"cell_type":"raw","metadata":{"collapsed":false},"source":[]}}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
